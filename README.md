Azure Databricks and Azure SQL database can be used amazingly well together. This repo will help you to use the [latest connector](https://github.com/microsoft/sql-spark-connector) to load data into Azure SQL as fast as possible, using table partitions and column-store and all the known best-practices.

- [Partitioned Tables and Indexes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/partitions/partitioned-tables-and-indexes)
- [Columnstore indexes: Overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/indexes/columnstore-indexes-overview)
- [Columnstore indexes - Data loading guidance](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/indexes/columnstore-indexes-data-loading-guidance)

## Samples

All the samples start from a partitioned Parquet file, created with data generated from the famous TPC-H benchmark. Free tools are available on TPC-H website to generate a dataset with the size you want:

http://www.tpc.org/tpch/

Once the Parquet file is available, 

- [Create Parquet File](./notebooks/00-create-parquet-file.ipynb)

the samples will guide you through the most common scenarios

- [Loading a non-partitioned table](./notebooks/01-load-into-single-table.ipynb)
- [Loading a partitioned table](./notebooks/01-load-into-partitioned-table.ipynb)
- [Loading a partitioned table via switch-in](./notebooks/03a-parallel-switch-in-load-into-partitioned-table-many.ipynb)

all samples will also show how to correctly load table if there are already indexes or if you want to use a column-store in Azure SQL.
